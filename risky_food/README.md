# Risky Food Simulation

## summary

Game: risky food source is 3 if **N**, 1 if **C**; safe source is 2

N:
: non-contaminated 
C:
: contaminated

Every agent gets a parameter r between 0 and 1.  [or DISCRETE: 8 buckets etc.]

EACH ROUND:
- Nature selects a probability p for N
- For each agent: if r > p, then they choose RISKY; else SAFE
- Nature flips a coin with bias p for N, and announces N or C
- If N: everyone who chose RISKY gets 3, everyone who chose SAFE gets 2
- If C: everyone who chose RISKY gets 1, everyone SAFE 2
- Reproduce in proportion to payoff
- Either agent gets # of offspring = payoff [they replace–original “dies off”]
  OR: take the total payoff for RISKYs over total for everyone, there are that proportion of RISKYs in the new population

END ROUND

SEE: We’ll see what are the risk attitudes that are replicated more and less over time
